Hello,
I decided to write down my Motivation for this tiny Project.

In my real life I'am a ambitious Biker.
To improve my skill and to get better control of the bike I decided to learn
hanging-off(wo knee down).

But in the past I never use nearly the full potential of my Bike.
To figure out which the current inclination I just start this Project.

I know, that there are few Apps of ECU build in features on the market....but....
...my bike is old :), and to improve my skills in Programming I choose to
implement a little Application for Arduino.

I'm studying Information Engineering at TH Cologne (Germany).
My specialist field is not Android Programming, but I'm really interested in.
I'm Student and try to manage this with little money.
I ordered an Arduino Nano (Uno for development environment), an 128x64 OLED-Display
and finally a MPU6050(GY-521).
An Android or Apple-Application wouldn't be the way to go.
I wanted a small Case with all the needed functionality.
My Solution were the best way for me.
I hope my solution will help people in future to build a reliable Solution to
measure the current inclination of your Motorcycle.

Sincere regards,

Simon
